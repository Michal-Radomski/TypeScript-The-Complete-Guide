In TypeScript, both **interfaces** and **types** serve the purpose of defining the structure of objects, but they have distinct characteristics and use cases. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

## Key Differences

### Definition
- **Interface**: A syntactical contract that defines the structure of an object, including properties and methods. It is primarily used for defining object shapes.
- **Type**: A more versatile construct that can define not only object shapes but also primitive types, unions, intersections, tuples, and more complex type definitions.

### Extensibility
- **Interface**: Supports **declaration merging**, allowing multiple declarations with the same name to be merged into a single interface. This makes interfaces extendable and adaptable.
- **Type**: Cannot be reopened or merged once defined. If you try to declare a type with the same name again, it will raise an error.

### Syntax
- **Interface**: Uses the `interface` keyword.
- **Type**: Uses the `type` keyword.

### Flexibility
- **Interface**: Less flexible than types; primarily focused on object-oriented design.
- **Type**: More flexible; can represent complex types like unions and intersections.

### Usage with Primitives and Other Types
- **Interface**: Generally used for defining objects and their methods. Cannot directly represent primitives or union types.
- **Type**: Can define primitives, unions, intersections, tuples, and more, making it suitable for a wider range of scenarios.

### Implementation
- **Interface**: Can be implemented by classes. Interfaces are often preferred in scenarios where you need to define contracts for classes.
- **Type**: Can also be implemented but is less common; it's often used for simpler type definitions or when working with functions.

### Error Handling
- **Interface**: Provides clearer error messages during development when conflicts arise (e.g., conflicting method signatures).
- **Type**: May result in less informative error messages due to its more abstract nature.

## When to Use Each

- **Use Interfaces When**:
  - You need to define the shape of an object or class that will be implemented.
  - You want to take advantage of declaration merging.
  - You are working within an object-oriented paradigm.

- **Use Types When**:
  - You need to create union or intersection types.
  - You are defining primitive types or tuples.
  - You require advanced type features like mapped types or conditional types.

In summary, while both interfaces and types can be used to describe object structures in TypeScript, interfaces are generally preferred for defining contracts in object-oriented programming due to their extensibility and clarity. Types offer greater flexibility for defining various data structures and complex type compositions[1][4][5].
